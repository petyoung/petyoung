- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @petyoung
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m doing my best to study the arduino and the ESP32 cam to use in projects.
--->I built some projects some years ago using the arduino and they were successful but I could not work out how. I just followed instructions but learned nothing.
My problem is in the main the ammount of medication I now have to take just to live and that is not expected to be too long.  My heart has after numeous attacks all but given out.
Has anyone any ideas.  I have just invested in some good books on the arduino, the esp32cam and electronics, but still find my medication making it hard to read or take anything in.
Its like I am up agaist a brick wall but if my will has anything to do with it this time I will succeed.
I have also purchased two kits but this time i will learn,
